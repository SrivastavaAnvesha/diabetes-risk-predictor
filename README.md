# Diabetes Risk Predictor

This is a simple AI-powered web app built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **scikit-learn** to predict the risk of diabetes based on user health inputs.

## 📌 Features

- User-friendly interface to input health parameters
- Predicts the risk of diabetes using a trained machine learning model
- Shows the prediction result and the confidence level
- Built using **Streamlit** for a web-based experience

## 🧪 Dataset

The app uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which is included in the project as `diabetes.csv`.  
This dataset contains medical diagnostic measurements to determine the likelihood of diabetes.

## 🛠 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or download** this project folder  
2. **Install the required libraries** using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. **Run the Streamlit app** using:

```
streamlit run diabetes_predictor.py

```
